- [x] Synchronized Ctrl+A Selection Hierarchy (Context-sensitive shortcut routing between canvas elements, photo filmstrip, and spread drawer)
- [x] Standard Formal Date Formatting (Implemented `formatStandardDate` conforming to Indonesian formal standard / PUEBI "D MMMM YYYY", resolving raw/informal timestamps in update dialogues)

## Phase 16 — Native Window Close Interception, Unsaved Changes Alert & Global Filmstrip Selection Clearance
- [x] Native OS Window Close Interception (Rust `.on_window_event` intercepts `CloseRequested` cleanly without IPC security rejections)
- [x] Unsaved Changes Protection Alert (Automatic dirty state synchronization from Zustand store to Rust backend prevents accidental application closing when changes are unsaved)
- [x] Direct Native Force Exit Command (`exit_app` in Rust with `app.exit(0)` and `std::process::exit(0)` for clean, non-hanging shutdown on "Exit Without Saving")
- [x] Uninhibited Window Close for Saved Projects (Native OS window close button 'X' closes immediately with 0 delay when project is saved or on Welcome screen)
- [x] Global Filmstrip Selection Dismissal (Capturing pointerdown listener and spread drawer capture ensure clicking anywhere outside the filmstrip immediately deselects photos)
- [x] Professional Topbar Alignment & Help Menu (Dedicated 'Help ▾' dropdown containing Settings and About, with centered project action controls)

## Phase 17 — Dynamic Per-Corner Rounded Corners & In-Frame Crop Rotation (v1.0.33)
- [x] Dynamic Per-Corner Frame Rounded Corners (Physical unit normalization, independent TL, TR, BR, BL radii, Konva clipping & border geometry)
- [x] High-Resolution Rust Export Anti-Aliased Rounded Corners (Subpixel $\alpha$-masking for photo clipping and rounded borders)
- [x] SQLite Migration v12 (`corner_radius_tl`, `corner_radius_tr`, `corner_radius_br`, `corner_radius_bl` persistence)
- [x] Spread Previews Synchronization (`PageNavigator` & `ExportSpreadPreview` reflecting rounded frame geometry)

- [x] In-Frame Photo Crop Rotation & Canvas Previews (White void backing, unified rotation button, angle synchronization across preview & export)

## Phase 18 — Safe Margin Zero-Value Consistency & Falsy Logic Elimination
- [x] Zero Safe Margin Preservation (Fixed `min={0.1}` clamping in `NewProjectDialog` allowing exact `0` safe margin for full-bleed and borderless layouts)
- [x] Falsy Logical OR Fix (Replaced `project.marginValue || 10` with nullish coalescing `?? 10` across album creation, spreads, and workspace properties)
- [x] Initial Spread 4-Sided Margin Binding (`createInitialAlbum` now binds `safeAreaTop`, `safeAreaBottom`, `safeAreaOutside`, `safeAreaSpine` to Cover and Spread 1)
- [x] Whole Pixel Stepping & Precision (`px` canvas units now use `step=1` and `precision=0` across wizard, workspace properties, and structure panels)
- [x] Zero-Value Guide Clamping Removal (`SpreadCanvas` and `AlbumStructurePanel` updated to support `0px` safe area margins cleanly)
- [x] Test Suite Assertion Consistency (Resolved legacy test assertions and added comprehensive Section 12 unit tests for zero safe margins and seamless spine folds)
- [x] Dynamic Template Dropdown Unit Synchronization (`formatPresetLabel` dynamically converts template dropdown dimensions to match the active project unit `mm`/`cm`/`inch`/`px`)
- [x] Smart Cross-Unit Preset Matching (`findMatchingPreset` tolerance matching prevents active preset from resetting to "Custom Dimensions" when changing units)
- [x] Active Unit Preservation on Preset Select (`handlePresetSelect` converts template dimensions to the user's active unit instead of forcibly resetting `canvasUnit`)

## Phase 19 — Release v1.0.36: Typography & Text Engine Recovery
- [x] Restored the complete typography and text engine implementation from Git snapshot `660de5deb9e6b4f9c7051d10e33e762eb8eb6542`.
- [x] Core text placement, physical measurement, frame resizing, dynamic height/content fitting, inline editing, previews, and bundled font assets verified.
- [x] Rust export text rasterizer and high-resolution export synchronization restored.
- [x] Full test suite validation: all 62 restored files verified; unit tests (`npm test`), production build (`npm run build`), Rust text rasterizer tests, and 240 canvas browser assertions passing.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.36`.

## Phase 20 — Release v1.0.37: Text Frame Resize Jitter Elimination & Transform Stability
- [x] Fractional Font-Size Preservation: Preserved fractional font sizes during corner resizing so fitted lines do not alternate between wrapping and unwrapping at 0.1 pt rounding boundaries.
- [x] Styled-Range Font Release Consistency: Committed styled-range font sizes with the exact scale used by the live preview, eliminating changes on mouse release.
- [x] Text Frame Overflow Indicator Clipping: Kept the overflow indicator, including its stroke, safely inside the text frame even for frames smaller than the indicator. Its appearance no longer alters bounds used by Konva Transformer.
- [x] Comprehensive Browser Regression Suite: Added `Run Resize Regression` in `tests/typography-browser.html` covering eight handles at 0°/45°, direction reversal, fractional corner resizing of fitted text, release consistency, and overflow bounds (all 547 resize assertions pass).
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.37`.

### Text Resize and Auto Size Follow-up — 8 September 2026

- [x] Keep the frame transform under Konva ownership throughout a resize; update text drawing synchronously, use frame-only transform bounds, and normalize geometry once on release.
- [x] Measure live corner-resize text at its starting font size to preserve line wrapping and glyph alignment during continuous scaling.
- [x] Preserve Auto Size selection across single and group resizing. Height Only continues fitting text through the document update operation.
- [x] Fit Frame to Content can expand a narrow column up to the page width; Fit buttons read committed text and report when the frame already fits.
- Validation: code review, whitespace check, and TypeScript `tsc --noEmit` passed; tests and interactive verification were not run, as requested.

### Inter-Object Gap Guide Accuracy — 8 September 2026

- [x] Restrict gap guides to strictly facing neighbors with overlapping projections; position dimension lines in the shared overlapping span rather than pairing diagonal objects.
- [x] Apply a 25 mm proximity threshold for displaying individual adjacent gap indicators, eliminating cluttered guides between distant objects across the canvas.
- [x] Derive gap values from snapped geometry, remove obsolete collinear snap lines superseded by equidistant snapping, and account for rotated frame bounds.
- [x] Position distance badges beside dimension lines to keep narrow gaps and endpoint tick marks visible.

## Project Save/Open Integrity — 8 September 2026
- [x] Restrict editable documents to AFSN; ZIP packages are extracted before opening and never become Save/autosave targets.
- [x] Atomic AFSN/ZIP file publication, strict asset-copy error handling, and unchanged destination files after failed writes.
- [x] Transactional project imports, independent copy identities, preserved photo collection membership, and relative asset resolution.
- [x] Guarded Save/Save As/autosave pipeline, serialized recovery writes, honest failure/dirty state, and protection for edits made during saves.
- [x] Full file save for Save & Continue / Save & Exit, unsaved protection for external opens, and explicit save/open errors.
- [x] Regression tests for real ZIP extraction/edit/save/reopen, failure rollback, cancellation, and concurrent edits. Details and compatibility limits are recorded in `PROJECT_PERSISTENCE_AUDIT.md`.

### Missing Project File Recovery — 9 September 2026

- [x] Mark cached recent projects unsaved when their AFSN file is missing; explain the location choice in the recovery dialog.
- [x] Prompt for a destination on manual Save when the original file is missing, retaining the recovered project identity and updating its recent entry after successful publication.
- [x] Keep autosave limited to recovery checkpoints for missing files; preserve the existing path and unsaved state on cancellation or failure.
- [x] Add regression coverage for missing recent files, autosave, destination selection, cancellation, failed writes, subsequent saves, and edits during the recovery picker.

## Four-Sided Margin Persistence — 8 September 2026

- [x] Persist Top, Bottom, Outside, and Spine project defaults through the Tauri command and SQLite project schema.
- [x] Persist independent safe-area values on every cover and interior spread through Save, Save As, AFSN, and packaged export workflows.
- [x] SQLite migration v13 backfills existing projects and spreads from the legacy uniform margin while older AFSN documents retain the same fallback behavior.
- [x] Add native regression coverage for asymmetric project and spread margin round trips.

### Phase 21 — Release v1.0.39: Multi-Select Text Proportional Font Scaling & Overflow Fix
- [x] Preserve exact unrounded floating-point font sizes and styled-range sizes during multi-selection resize in `calculateRotatedMultiFrameResize` and `calculateMultiFrameResize`.
- [x] Use ceiled hundredth rounding (`Math.ceil`) for text element dimensions so continuous multi-selection scaling never shrinks frame boundaries below tightly fitted text content.
- [x] Relax layout engine word-wrap and overflow detection tolerance to `0.05 pt` in `richTextRenderer.ts`, eliminating false rewraps and false red `+` overflow badges caused by unit conversion float drift.
- [x] Route multi-frame updates for text elements through `updateTextNode` in `batchUpdateFrames` to guarantee clean style normalization and height auto-sizing.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.39`.

### Phase 22 — Release v1.0.40: Photo Lifecycle, Import Reliability & Cache Cleanup Hardening

- [x] Audit import, thumbnail/preview generation, and library removal; record evidence and priorities in `PHOTO_LIFECYCLE_AUDIT.md`.
- [x] Preserve confirmed removal IDs across dialog interactions and provide reliable busy, success, and error feedback (F1/F7).
- [x] Coordinate transactional photo/frame removal, project dirty state, and Undo/Redo asset validity (F2/F3).
- [x] Replace filename-only duplicate/relink identity checks and propagate import/processing failures accurately (F4/F5).
- [x] Coordinate cache writers with cleanup; separate committed library removal from deferred cache maintenance (F6).
- [x] Return correct thumbnail paths for all formats, invalidate stale caches, and isolate recovery cancellation per job (F8/F9).
- [x] Implement image/EXIF validation, recursive folder scanning limits, decoder memory limits, and restricted asset filesystem scope (F10).
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.40`.

### Phase 23 — Release v1.0.41: Photo Collection Consistency & Transactional Membership

- [x] Complete photo/collection removal dialog feedback and project snapshots, modal shortcut guards, committed favorite updates, and dirty-state tracking for collection changes.
- [x] Make collection membership additions and moves transactional, reject cross-project membership, and surface library errors without replacing failed collection reads with empty results.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.41`.

### Phase 24 — Release v1.0.42: Compact Icon-Only Lock Controls & UI Space Optimization

- [x] Streamline Multi-Selection, Selected Text Box, and Selected Photo Frame lock controls in the right Properties panel.
- [x] Replace text-heavy labels with compact 24×24 px icon-only SVG buttons to eliminate horizontal header overcrowding.
- [x] Replace emoji lock/unlock glyphs with crisp, accessible vector SVG paths and informative tooltips.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.42`.

### Phase 25 — Release v1.0.43: Non-Uniform Corner Radius Save Fix & 4-Corner Inspector Redesign

- [x] Fix SQLite save error when photo frames have independent (non-uniform) per-corner radii using `CornerRadiusPayload` serde untagged enum.
- [x] Redesign right inspector Corner Radius panel into a sleek 2x2 physical grid with dynamic vector corner glyph indicators and canvas unit suffix.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.43`.

### Phase 26 — Release v1.0.44: Adaptive Layout Engine Restoration & Full Template Variety

- [x] Revert experimental adaptive layout constraints and ratio-warping transformations back to the rich, stable `edf0c62` baseline.
- [x] Restore full diversity of geometric templates (1 to 12+ photos, diptychs, triptychs, multi-row, collages, and grids).
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.44`.

### Phase 27 — Release v1.0.45: Adaptive Layout Edge Confinement, Canvas Edge Alignment & Save Status Synchronization

- [x] Fix canvas edge measurement and perimeter gaps in adaptive layout engine: `getProjectDimensionsInCanvasUnit` now respects `project.marginEnabled` (margins evaluate to 0 when disabled), allowing layouts to expand cleanly to canvas boundaries.
- [x] Eliminate sub-pixel / sub-millimeter perimeter gaps in `partitionPageBoxIntoKRects` by absorbing fractional column and row dimensions into terminal partitions, guaranteeing 0 gap against page boundaries.
- [x] Partition Count 1 now produces full-bleed flush rectangles filling 100% of the usable box.
- [x] Add dual alignment modes: **Align to Canvas Edge** (`targetMode: 'page_edge'`) and **Align to Safe Margin** (`targetMode: 'safe_margin'`) in Single-Frame Inspector, Multi-Selection Inspector, and Canvas Right-Click context menus.
- [x] Multi-selection alignment to canvas edges moves the composite bounding box flush to the target edge while preserving exact internal relative spacing and gaps.
- [x] Fix toolbar Save button staying orange after save: implement `isAlbumDesignEqual` / `isSpreadDesignEqual` / `isElementDesignEqual` to distinguish runtime thumbnail/preview cache updates from user design edits, preventing background asset generation from resetting `saveStatus` to `unsaved`.
- [x] Enhance `calculateSnapping` to magnetically snap to the center spine / fold line on layflat albums with zero gutter width.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.45`.

### Phase 28 — Release v1.0.46: Full-Bleed Adaptive Layout Variations (Edge-to-Edge)

- [x] Fix persistent gap between photo frames and canvas edge in adaptive layout engine: all photo counts (1–6+) now generate **full-bleed variations** that place frames flush to the physical page edge `(0, 0)` → `(pageWidth, spreadHeight)`, with zero gap to canvas boundaries.
- [x] Single-photo (count=1) full-bleed variations (`Right Page Full Bleed`, `Left Page Full Bleed`, `Full Bleed Panoramic Spread`) now appear as the first/highest-priority layout options, before safe-margin-confined variations.
- [x] Multi-photo (count ≥ 2) full-bleed per-page split variations: `partitionPageBoxIntoKRects` operates on page-edge bounding boxes instead of safe-margin-inset boxes, producing layouts flush to canvas edge on all 4 sides.
- [x] Multi-photo (count ≥ 2) full-bleed spread-wide variations: photos span the entire spread edge-to-edge as a single collage, tagged with `'full-bleed'` and `'spread'`.
- [x] Existing safe-margin-confined variations are preserved alongside full-bleed options, giving users both edge-to-edge and margin-respecting layout choices.
- [x] Test suite updated: safe-margin confinement test now correctly excludes full-bleed tagged variations; new tests verify full-bleed presence and canvas-edge contact for counts 1–6.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.46`.

### Canvas Edge Precision Follow-Up — 9 September 2026

- [x] Preserve fractional physical positions during canvas, safe-margin, and selection alignment so edge contact and relative frame spacing survive the alignment operation.
- [x] Remove tenth-unit rounding from photo cover dimensions and crop offsets; photos now cover fractional adaptive-layout frames without exposing thin background strips.
- [x] Use one physical-to-screen scale for the Konva sheet, frame geometry, facing-page boundary, and safe-area guides, avoiding independent pixel rounding at different zoom levels.
- [x] Preserve exact resize-snap bounds and photo geometry on pointer release; use converted four-sided margins consistently with canvas guides instead of the raw spread margin.
- [x] Add resize regressions for fractional bottom/corner and side snapping, stationary opposite edges, zero/asymmetric bottom margins, and viewport conversion at multiple zoom levels.
- [x] Add strict regression assertions for fractional alignment in mm/cm/inch/print-pixel scales, photo coverage at pan/zoom limits, and adaptive layout through frame creation and viewport projection (1–12 photos).
- [x] Validate with `npm test` and `npx tsc --noEmit`; native desktop visual verification remains manual.

### Save Status After Photo Cache Refresh — 9 September 2026

- [x] Preserve the prior document save status when synchronizing generated photo assets; let the queued database checkpoint manage its own saving transition so a successful file save does not become unsaved after cache refresh.

- [x] Preserve the document point at the viewport center during zoom and workspace extent changes, and translate selection, drop, context-menu paste, and resize snapping coordinates consistently.
- [x] Allow photo placement and paste outside the page, including negative coordinates; retain these objects in the saved spread.
- [x] Keep export bounded to the page and configured bleed. Only extend trim-aligned photo edges into bleed, without pulling pasteboard objects or shifting frames that cross the trim line.
- [x] Validate with `npm test`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and the native pasteboard/bleed export regression test.
- [x] Verify crop-handle dragging outside the page, moving a parked object onto the page, bottom-edge resize snapping after scrolling, and zoom in the browser fixture (`/tests/pasteboard.preview.html`). Native desktop interaction verification remains manual.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.49`.

### Phase 31 — Release v1.0.50: Exact Center Spine Snapping & Canvas Boundary Contrast

- [x] Quantize native export frame geometry from shared left/right/top/bottom edges instead of independently rounding positions and dimensions.
- [x] Propagate configured Photo Spacing through a 2D topological neighbor graph while preserving trim, spine, and page-edge anchors.
- [x] Use the same aligned export-pixel bounds for photo and text objects without mutating stored layout or crop geometry.
- [x] Add pixel-level native render regressions for uniform horizontal/vertical gaps and a seam-free layflat spine at 240, 300, and 600 DPI across px, mm, and inch projects.
- [ ] Manually compare the affected album in native JPEG, PNG, and PDF exports at print resolution.

### Phase 64 — Release v1.0.71: Modern Emerald Update Theme & Settings Cleanup

- [x] Unify toolbar update button styling with an elevated modern emerald green gradient, matching hover/active glow states, and pulse animations.
- [x] Replace raw emojis in update status buttons with crisp, scalable vector SVG icons.
- [x] Streamline Software Updates card in Settings dialog by removing redundant technical subtitle copy.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.71`.

### Phase 65 — Release v1.0.72: General Preferences, Recovery Controls & Safe Cache Maintenance

- [x] Rename the Preferences sidebar entry from `General & App` to the standard desktop label `General`.
- [x] Expand General Preferences into focused `Startup & Projects`, `Saving & Recovery`, `Storage & Cache`, and `Software Updates` cards.
- [x] Persist launch behavior, auto-save enablement and interval, and automatic update-check preferences locally for offline startup availability.
- [x] Support reopening the most recent project while preserving file-association launch priority.
- [x] Keep crash-recovery snapshots permanently active while allowing project-file auto-save timing to be configured.
- [x] Report generated preview-cache usage and safely clean only orphaned thumbnails, previews, and interrupted temporary files.
- [x] Display update state dynamically instead of presenting an unconditional up-to-date status.
- [x] Replace native General-tab dropdowns with modern startup choice cards and compact auto-save interval segments.
- [x] Standardize cache/update action rows and show self-dismissing cleanup feedback directly inside the Storage & Cache card.
- [x] Remove the misleading recent-project capacity counter from Startup & Projects without changing recent-project retention behavior.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.72`.

### Phase 66 — Release v1.0.73: Preflight Overwrite Warning Layout & Modern Crimson Action Button

- [x] Refactor Overwrite Warning preflight file list into clean flex rows with document icons, text overflow truncation, and dedicated warning pill badges.
- [x] Fix cramped spacing by ensuring the "Will be overwritten" badge is separated and distinct from the target filename.
- [x] Modernize the destructive "Overwrite Existing Files" button with high-contrast crimson styling, subtle elevation lift (`translateY(-1px)`), luminous glow on hover, and active feedback.
- [x] Remove inline button background styling that suppressed CSS hover pseudo-classes.
- [x] Standardize preflight Missing Photos modal list and warning button with matching design tokens.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.73`.

### Phase 67 — Release v1.0.74: Spine Margin Decimals & MiniSpreadPreview Gap Rendering

- [x] Enable 1-decimal precision (`precision=1`, `step=0.5`) for `px` and `mm` units across all margin and spacing inputs (Spine, Outside, Top, Bottom, Uniform, Safe Area Inset).
- [x] Broaden target gap matching tolerance in `alignPreviewElementBounds` to correctly recognize facing-page split spine margins (e.g. 2.5 + 2.5 = 5.0 px).
- [x] Enforce Physical Gap Invariant in `previewGeometry.ts` guaranteeing intentional canvas gaps (> 0.5 px) never collapse to 0 px in mini preview thumbnails.
- [x] Render subtle spine crease fold line (`spineX`) in `MiniSpreadPreview` behind page content for clear visual sheet separation.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.74`.

### Phase 68 — Release v1.0.75: Canvas Photo Drag-Swap & Crop Interaction Follow-Up

- [x] Add a dedicated on-canvas center drag handle for swapping photo content between two canvas frames without moving their geometry; remove the less-direct left-toolbar drag mechanism.
- [x] Preserve existing canvas gestures: normal drag moves, `Shift + Drag` constrains, `Ctrl + Drag` bypasses snapping, and `Alt + Drag` duplicates.
- [x] Restrict swap targets to different unlocked photo frames, resolve rotated targets precisely, cancel invalid drops without mutation, and retain the `S` shortcut as the keyboard fallback.
- [x] Add compact topmost amber target feedback (`Release`) independent of artwork z-index, keep the `⇄` handle as the drag preview, use one-step Undo through `swapFrames`, and add regression coverage for exact safe-target resolution.
- [x] Hide the `⇄` swap handle while its selected frame body is being moved, then restore it at the committed frame position after drag completion or interruption.
- [x] Allow Crop Mode to exit through a primary click or tap on empty canvas/pasteboard space while preserving crop interaction inside the active photo.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.75`.

### Phase 69 — Release v1.0.76: Context-Aware Shortcuts Reference & Layout Cycle HUD

- [x] Audit and rebuild the Settings shortcut reference with accurate implemented combinations, dedicated Crop and Photo guidance, context labels, searchable notes, clearer key chords, and responsive rows.
- [x] Resolve the shared `S` key context so two selected photos perform Swap without also triggering Smart Layout Shuffle.
- [x] Replace separate Group/Ungroup visuals in the floating left toolbar with one stable-icon toggle: neutral while ungrouped, cyan only while the selected group is active, matching the Border toggle behavior.
- [x] Standardize locked photo and text selection feedback as a thin solid amber outline shown only while the locked object is selected, without transform handles.
- [x] Keep cyan and amber selection outlines visible at flush canvas edges by rendering selection feedback above the sheet perimeter and insetting screen-space strokes within object bounds.
- [x] Enforce absolute lock protection inside mixed grouped selections by excluding locked members from Transformer bounds, live drag/resize/rotation, and store-level geometry commits.
- [x] Refine Layout Cycle HUD visual styling, status indicators, and keyboard context feedback.
- [x] Application version metadata bumped to `v1.0.76`.
